		 * Adds a method that hooks into the setter process of an observable

		 * property's change.
		 * 
		 * To cancel the property change, return the oldValue. This means there
		 * is no change and the remaining hooks and observers will not be run.
		 * 
		 * To alter the new property value return the desired value.
		 * 
		 * If no value is returned at all, the process will continue as if that
		 * hook hadn't run. This will also be the case if <code>newValue</code>
		 * is returned unchanged.
		 * 
		 * Hooks are run in the order in which they were added.

		 * @param The target object for which the hook will apply. If a class
		 * object is provided then all objects of that class type or a subclass
		 * will utilize the hook.
		 * 
		 * @param The name of the property which the hook should attempt to
		 * alter. <code>"*"</code> may be used to indicate any property. A comma
		 * delimited string of properties may be used to add one hook to
		 * multiple properties in one call.
		 * 
		 * @param The hook host is the object which the hook method belongs to.
		 * It is needed to ensure a weak-referenced system. If the hook does not
		 * have an <code>IEventDispatcher</code> it belongs to, <code>null</code>
		 * may be passed in, but the hook must be referenced directly by a
		 * property due to how weak-referenced dictionaries hold functions.
		 * Example:
		 * <code>
		 * private function theHook(...):* {...}
		 * private var myHook:Function = theHook; // reference to method
		 * </code>
		 * This is only needed if <code>hookHost</code> is null;
		 * 
		 * @param The hook is a method with one of the following signatures or
		 * something similar (e.g. if you know only strings will be processed,
		 * you can type <code>oldValue</code>, <code>newValue</code>, and the
		 * return type to String rather than <code>*</code>).
