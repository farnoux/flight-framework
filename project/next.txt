* do a size evaluation of each major feature (file size in SWF)

* test-run of a MXML-defined DomainController, complete with MacroCommands (lists of actions)

* replace bindable Array types with IList's throughout the framework

* refactor binding to move applyOnly out and property-updates in (right now the shared Binding's will
	break if shared between someone who needs applyOnly and someone who needs 2-way)
* find a way to make bindEventListener truly be weak-reference (build into a baseclass?)


* refactor XMLConfig to use flight services (objectize the xml structure)

future features:
* add flight services as an alternative to flex services
